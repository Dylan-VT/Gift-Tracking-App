### How to Use
After building and running the app locally via XCode, users should register their account on the start up screen and enter their name and birthday. Once registered and logged in, users can view the birthdays of their contacts on the home screen. Contacts are organized in order of upcoming birthdays. To add contacts, click the '+' icon on the home screen and enter an existing user's username. If a contact does not already have an account, simply register their name and birthday from the register page utilized at the beginning of using the app. Clicking on a contact from the home page shows a profile view. This view highlights key information regarding their birthday. Each user has a unique to-do list wich can be used for planning gifts. This list persists and items can be added, removed, and reordered as expected.
